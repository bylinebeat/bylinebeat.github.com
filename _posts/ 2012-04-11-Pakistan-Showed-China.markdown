        <h1>Pakistan let China see crashed US &quot;stealth&quot; copter</h1><div><p>(Reuters)</p>
<p>Pakistan gave China access to the previously unknown U.S. &#8220;stealth&#8221; helicopter that crashed during the commando raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May despite explicit requests from the CIA not to, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.<br/><br/>The disclosure, if confirmed, is likely to further shake the U.S.-Pakistan relationship, which has been improving slightly after hitting its lowest point in decades following the killing of bin Laden.<br/><br/>During the raid, one of two modified Blackhawk helicopters, believed to employ unknown stealth capability, malfunctioned and crashed, forcing the commandos to abandon it.<br/><br/>&#8220;The U.S. now has information that Pakistan, particularly the ISI, gave access to the Chinese military to the downed helicopter in Abbottabad,&#8221; the paper quoted a person &#8220;in intelligence circles&#8221; as saying on its website.<br/><br/>It said Pakistan, which enjoys a close relationship with China, allowed Chinese intelligence officials to take pictures of the crashed aircraft as well as take samples of its special &#8220;skin&#8221; that allowed the American raid to evade Pakistani radar.</p></div>
