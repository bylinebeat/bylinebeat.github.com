(Brooklyn, New York) The police helicopter buzzed, swooped, and hovered over the gathering to mark what used to be called Labor Day in the United States until the post-WWI hysteria against anything deemed “red” separated this land from the rest of the world, which still commemorates the struggle for labor rights as May Day. It was only natural that Occupy Wall Street got involved. Observing and tagging along through a blazing hot afternoon, a massive column funneled out from Byrant Park and spilled out onto Broadway—against the wishes of fellow ninety-nine-percenter cops, who were seen beating back a few onto the sidewalks until, in an evitable crush, the swarm could not be contained.

Not that the police had anything to fear. Nearly all of the few thousand or so marchers were peaceful. As this reporter ran through the streets to catch up or keep pace, and at times the column of protesters stopped and started, a gaggle of guitarists strummed the strains of “This Land is Your Land,” an anthem of a bygone era that held resonance for those who attended and gave cover to the myriad causes for which they marched: immigrant rights, jobs that pay living wages, peace activism and other strands that tied together at the northern edge of Union Square in the form of a sculpture whose sign read “All of Our Grievances Are Connected.”

Whether they are or not seems less relevant than the fact that many people actually showed up, cheerfully, passionately, and defiant. Once the assembly had reached the square, speakers and music acts galvanized the audience. The buzzing of the copter blades and the sirens around did not deter hundreds of people from, well, having a good time. No workshops on how to translate all their energy into social change were seen when Tom Morello and Immortal Technique were the headliners. The concert-like atmosphere circled back to the message, that is messages: the (fill-in-the-blank) system is corrupt.

Imani stood by the migrant rights contingent, with signs decrying the racist and exploitative treatment of some of the most vulnerable workers. For her, this was just one piece of a larger picture, a puzzle where the interlocking issues of student debt, foreclosures, predatory greed, and imperial foreign policy coalesce more or less into a joyful and committed tide of all colors—a diversity seldom times seen at many Occupy events. “We’re all coming together,” she said.

Speaker after speaker spoke of solidarity with those in attendance in spirit, or just those who could not afford to take the day off. If the people, united, can never be defeated, perhaps it is time for a movement that has finally sloughed off the doldrums of the winter months to take its messages and energy out to those who are not already converted, away from the choir to whom it is preaching, and into the world of the people on the fence. In other words, haters are gonna hate, so it makes no sense for OWS and other affinity groups to appeal to them to change their minds. What seems more sensible, in the long run, is still being hashed out. If communists really organized this march, it would be better organized.

This anti-plutocracy movement does not have an expiration date, and that will be tested as a hot summer awaits, but its fragmented and confused nature does.
