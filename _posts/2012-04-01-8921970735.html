&lt;p&gt;President Obama&amp;#8217;s summer woes have dragged his approval rating to an all-time low, sinking below 40% for the first time in Gallup&amp;#8217;s daily tracking poll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New data posted Sunday shows that 39% of Americans approve of Obama&amp;#8217;s job performance, while 54% disapprove. Both are the worst numbers of his presidency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obama&amp;#8217;s approval rating has hovered in the 40% range for much of 2011, peaking at 53% in the weeks following the death of Osama bin Laden.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post>
