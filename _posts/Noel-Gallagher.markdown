(Bowling Green, Ohio) “Winning The Break-Up.” It’s the one thing that everyone nonchalantly tries to accomplish when ending a long-term relationship. 

In the case of Noel and Liam Gallagher, Noel, the elder brother, walked away the victor. The brotherly love that formed Oasis and held it together for 18 years ended with Noel walking out on the band before a gig in Paris. 

After the fall of Oasis, the brothers from Manchester, England, wasted little time going their separate ways. Liam and the remaining members of Oasis formed Beady Eye. Noel, on the other hand, decided to go solo.

Noel and his backup band dubbed themselves Noel Gallagher and the High Flying Birds (NGHFB) when they released their self-titled album in October 2011. The band quickly rose above Liam’s Beady Eye, selling over 600,000 records in the UK alone as of February 2012, while Beady Eye managed to sell fewer than 200,000 records.

Noel announced a world tour would begin after the release of their new record. Kicking off in Dublin, Ireland, in late October 2011, the band will play gigs through the summer and include festival appearances at Coachella, Isle of Wight, The V Festival, and Rock En Seine in Paris, where Noel infamously walked out on Oasis where they were scheduled to play three years previously.

Although Noel Gallagher is highly regarded as a legend overseas, NGHFB has only a small fan base here in the States. Oasis was just beginning to become a household name in America when the group disbanded in 2009, leaving Noel to only be known for such Oasis commercial hits as “Wonderwall” and “Champagne Supernova.” The fact that the man has played in front of a sold-out crowds at festivals, stadiums, and arenas all over Europe and still isn’t a household name among American music fans blows my mind.

But regardless of the fact that the majority of American music fans are missing out on what many call “The Next Paul McCartney,” I had the privilege of seeing Noel Gallagher and the High Flying Birds at a small, intimate venue in Columbus, Ohio. 

The LC Pavilion was set up to accommodate a smaller-than-usual crowd. Reserved chair seating took up the pit area, which is usually packed shoulder-to-shoulder with fans. The general admission area contained the majority of Noel supporters. Besides my friends and I, the crowd was old enough to remember driving to purchase Oasis’ debut album back in ’94. 

I expected to see the “2005 Oasis World Tour” t-shirts, so I was very surprised by the vast number of Manchester City jerseys that were in the venue. Everywhere I turned there was another “Gallagher #10” jersey staring me right in the face. If you haven’t caught on, Noel and Liam support Manchester City and are regular attendees at City home games.

As the group took the stage, it hit me on how great this performance was about to be. The LCD lights that made up the backdrop of the stage mimicked Oasis’ from their final years. Noel walked out with such a swagger that you thought he was still 24 years old, not 44. 

The band kicked off the 20-song set with “It’s Good To Be Free,” an Oasis hit from the early 90s. The crowd took a while to get comfortable, and it wasn’t until a few songs later that the crowd finally started singing along. “Dream On” and “If I Had a Gun,” both solid NGHFB commercial hits, were definitely the crowd favorites early on in the set.

Noel showed his English humor between songs as he interacted with the fans in the front row. Cursing every time he got the chance, he made it clear that he really had no idea where the hell he was. And although the alcohol and cocaine probably prevents him from lrecalling the last time he was in Ohio (2006. Taft Theater. Cincinnati), he definitely doesn’t know when he’ll be back.

“I don’t know when the fuck I will be back here in…where we at?…Oh right Columbus.”

“We have a day off here in Columbus tomorrow. Is there anything to fucking do? No…? Well alright then.”

After the solid 16-song outing, had the band not came back for an encore, everyone in attendance would still have been completely satisfied. But the band took the stage for a four more songs that included the most moving and spiritual song that any old Oasis fan would have surely appreciated.

Noel closed with “Don’t Look Back In Anger.” The song took those in attendance back to the original Oasis lineup, as if Liam himself was on stage in his sunglasses, singing to a stadium full of fans. Noel even went as far as to pull a vintage Liam move, stepping away from the microphone and letting the masses take over the chorus. It was a beautiful sound.

As I walked out of the venue, there was a buzz among the fans that witnessed the show. We were a part of something magical, that cold night in late-March. A man who once sold out stadiums and arenas around the world had just serenaded a small crowd in the middle of Ohio. It was truly an experience I will never forget.
