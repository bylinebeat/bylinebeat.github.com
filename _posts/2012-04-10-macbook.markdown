# Welcome Hello

Earlier this week, Ne-Yo puzzled Hip Hop fans when he announced that his next album will be titled The R.E.D. Album, a name that rapper Game used for his fourth LP just last year. Now, in a recent interview with XXL, the California native weighs in on the album name change.

While one would expect Game to have a few qualms with Ne-Yo using the same album title as him, the Compton rapper gave the R&B crooner his blessings. He added that while he doesn't understanding the reasoning behind the similarity of titles, he is sure that Ne-Yo has a good reason for adopting the album name.

“I don't know what that’s about, but I’ve always known Ne-Yo to be a cool dude, so I’m pretty sure he got his reasoning,” he explained. “More power to the lil’ homie.”

This isn't the first time Game and Ne-Yo have crossed paths. The duo collaborated on the songs "Camera Phone" and "Gentleman's Affair," both featured on the Compton's 2008 album LAX.
